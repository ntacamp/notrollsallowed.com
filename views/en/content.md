No Trolls Allowed is a gathering of hackers, engineers, scientists, makers, 
artists and geeks of any kind taking place under the open sky.
Primary objective of the gathering is to provide a scene and attentive 
listeners to those who want to share their passion for what they do either 
as part of their job, open source initiative, or their lifestyle. 
Some go further by throwing hacking parties or ad-hoc workshops inviting 
everyone to participate, experiment and learn something new. 

The foundation of the event is reflected in its name â€” 
at "No Trolls Allowed" no trolls are welcome. Only people having 
something to share are welcome, thus every single participant should 
prepare a presentation or a workshop; and these range wildly from 
rather short multimedia presentations to performances and games spanning 
multiple days. There are no restrictions on the range of topics and we 
usually expect at least some from psychology, board games, functional 
programming, visual or performance arts, soldering workshops and 
artisanal brewing. Then there is anything in between or outside of that.
