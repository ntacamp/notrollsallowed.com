No  Trolls Allowed is a gathering of hackers, engineers, scientists,
makers, artists and geeks of any other kind taking place under the
open sky.

Primary objective of the gathering is to provide a scene and attentive
listeners to those who want to share their passion for what they do
either as part of their job, open source initiative, or what becomes
their lifestyle. Some go further by throwing hacking parties or ad-hoc
workshops inviting everyone to participate, experiment and learn
something new.

The foundation of the event is reflected in it's name - at "No Trolls
Allowed" no trolls are welcome. Only people having something to share
are welcome thus every single participant should prepare a
presentation of sorts; and these range wildly from rather short
multimedia presentations, to performances and games spanning multiple
days.

There are no restrictions on the range of topics and we usually expect
at least some from psychology, board games, functional programming,
visual or performance arts, soldering workshops and artisanal
brewing. Then there is anything in between, or outside of that.
